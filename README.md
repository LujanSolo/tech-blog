[The Tech-Blog](https://)

## Description
  
As anyone who has read online technical documentation can tell you, keeping up with your written communication skills is an essential part of becoming a successful web developer. Blogs are not only an excellent way to stay in practice, but offer a forum to discuss ideas with other developers and to keep up on the latest vernacular, syntax and coding developments. <br />

This CMS-style blog-site provides that opportunity with its ability to publish your articles, blogsposts, thoughts and opinions.
